Initial POC Scope:
Will flash green if a south bound metro train can be walked to from my address 10-12 min
Will flash red if it can be ran to 6-9
Wont flash if there isnt a reachable train 

Additional Scope: 
Make metro logic into an API that can be pulled into an app
easier customization for origin and destination 

Write in C so it can be run natively from Arduino 

Add north bound vs south bound switch
